[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Linear-Regression-Project)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**94%** accuracy](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Logistric-Regression).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Steps-Involve-in-machine-learning-model)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/pghatani0811/KNN-NB-Projects).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Decision-Tree)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**80%** using **23** epochs](https://github.com/pghatani0811/K_meansProject).
